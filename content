What is websockets and socket.io with golang

WebSockets are a type of communication protocol that uses full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

In comparison to alternatives that use half-duplex communication, such as HTTP polling, full-duplex communication allows both the server and the client to transmit and receive data simultaneously without being interrupted, decreasing overhead.

WebSocket connections are requested by browsers and are responded to by servers, after which a connection is established.This is commonly called a handshake.

How to make a WebSocket application in Go To make a simple WebSocket echo server using the net/http library, you'll need to do the following:
1) Initiate a handshake
 2) Receive data frames from the client 
3) Send data frames to the client
 4) Close the handshake
Although using WebSockets in Go is simple and straightforward, this combination can have a significant impact on the performance of your application.

We have a few distinct alternatives for implementing websockets in Go.Socket-io is one of the most widely used libraries for frontend socket connection, we'll be using the Golang version to make integration easier.
